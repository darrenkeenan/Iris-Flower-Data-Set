Background research into Fisher's Iris Flower Data Set - A brief summary including python code, tables and graphics supporting my findings. 

Statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher introduced the Iris flower data set in the year 1936. The Iris data set, or also known as Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariate data set, meaning it “…is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of more the one outcome variable” (Wikipedia, Multivariate statistics; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics). 
	Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962), described as, "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science" Hald, Anders (1998); (A History of Mathematical Statistics. New York: Wiley) and "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics"  Efron, Bradley (1998), "R. A. Fisher in the 21st century", Statistical Science. 
	Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated procedures (such as "variation" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among group means. ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. (Wikipedia, Analysis of variance; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance).
