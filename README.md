# Iris-Flower-Data-Set
Background research into Fisher, Fisher's Iris Flower Data Set - A brief summary including python code, tables and graphics supporting my findings. 


Fisher Background:

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962), described as, "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science" (H. Anders, 1998) and "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics" (E. Bradley, 1998). 
As a scholarship recipient, Fisher studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 1912. “Fisher taught high school mathematics and physics from 1914 until 1919 while continuing his research in statistics and genetics. Fisher had evidenced a keen interest in evolutionary theory during his student days” (Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher | British geneticist and statistician) 
 “Evolution, theory in biology postulating that the various types of plants, animals, and other living things on Earth have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations…” (Evolution | scientific theory) Fisher's love for the evolution of plants, animals and other living things led to the foundation of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). “Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated procedures (such as "variation" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among group means” (Wikipedia, Analysis of variance) 


Iris Data Set:

As a "British statistician and geneticist who pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments..." (Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher | British geneticist and statistician), Fisher introduced the Iris flower data set in the year 1936. The Iris data set, or also known as Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariate data set, meaning it “…is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of more the one outcome variable” (Wikipedia, Multivariate statistics) The data set can also be considered as a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). 

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species/classes of Iris:
1.	Iris-Setosa
2.	Iris-Versicolor
3.	Iris-Virginica

The four features of the Iris dataset:
1.	Sepal length in cm
2.	Sepal width in cm
3.	Petal length in cm
4.	Petal width in cm

Please refer to file "irisdataset.py" to review a python script used to visualise the data set. Results are also posted within the file for review.

Fisher's Iris data set, contains a total of 150 samples of species/classes of Iris flowers. The data set can be reviewed and analysed in many ways. I have reviewed the data and using python, I have created a script targeting the various features of the Iris data set. My main goal was to identify the minimum and maximum value of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Please refer to files; "Sepal-Length.py", "Sepal-Width.py", "Petal-Length.py" and "Petal-Width.py", all of which contain a python script and posted results. Using the results obtained, I have created a histogram, located in the file "Min & Max" in the main repository. The histogram visually displays the minimum and maximum values found using the python scripts. Within the file, I have attached the whole data set scatter plot. Viewing the scatter plot, you can very eaily identify the minimum and maximum values of the colour coded species/classes as per the four features. Continuing my analysis, using the minimum and maximum value for both the petal length and petal width, I created a simple scatter plot to display my results using a python script. Running the script in python will allow you to visualise the scatter plot. From the output of the python script, it is clear that the result shows a coherent pattern suggesting that the petal width and length of the various species/classes grow evenly together. Using a multivariate data set created by Fisher and completing an analysis of variance, it is very clear that numerous results can be generated from a small sample of three classes/species of the Iris flower.
